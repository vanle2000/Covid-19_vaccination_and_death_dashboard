# Covid-19 Vaccinations and Deaths Data Exploration with SQL and Tableau


This project focuses on exploring COVID data using SQL and creating a dashboard that visualizes COVID deaths and infection rates. The project involves two main tasks: separating COVID data into deaths and vaccinations, and using the data to create an interactive dashboard using Tableau.
Exploring COVID data using SQL and creating a Covid deaths and infection rate dashboard.

## Project Tasks
1. Data Cleaning
The first task involves extracting and separating COVID data into two distinct datasets: COVID deaths and COVID vaccinations. This step allows us to analyze and visualize specific aspects of the COVID pandemic.

3. Extracting Essential Data using SQL Queries
- Utilize SQL to extract the necessary data for visualization. This step involves selecting relevant columns, applying filters, performing aggregations, and joining tables to obtain the specific information required for our dashboard. By leveraging SQL, we can ensure that the data used for visualization is tailored to our analysis objectives and provides accurate insights. The extracted data will serve as input for creating visualizations in Tableau.

3. Creating Tableau Dashboard
Using the COVID data, we will leverage Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes COVID deaths and infection rates. The dashboard will consist of four graphs, each providing a different perspective on the data:
- Global Statistics: This graph will present an overview of global COVID statistics, such as total deaths, total vaccinations, and infection rates.
- Total Deaths per Continent: This graph will showcase the total number of deaths per continent, allowing for regional comparison.
- Percent Population Infected per Country: This graph will display the percentage of the population infected by COVID in each country, offering a country-wise perspective.
- Projected Percent Population Infected: This graph will provide a projection of the percentage of the population that might be infected by COVID in the future, based on the available data.
